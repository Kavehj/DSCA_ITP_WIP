    "* Familiarise yourself with the Jupyter notebook, which is what we'll use to interact with python\n",
    "* Be able to describe Python's basic data types - integers, floats, strings and Boolean.\n",
    "* Explore python's general data structure objects - lists, tuples, and dictionaries.\n",
    "* Be able to write simple statements in Python for sequence, selection and iteration\n",
    "* Take a first look at 'pandas', python's data manipulation and analysis library.\n",
    "    * The Series and DataFrame objects.\n",

    "* Used by many people, giving it a large user base.\n",
    "* Open-source - It is much more cost effective and easier to maintain when compared to SAS and SPSS\n",

    "* High-level - Concise expressions compared to low-level languages (e.g. c, java etc.) giving greater productivity.\n",

When in **edit mode**, switch to **command mode** by clicking away, hitting esc, or by running the cell (shift/ctrl + enter). When in **command mode** you can switch to **edit mode** on the selected cell by hitting enter.

    "* **(re)Naming Notebooks** Just click on the title (e.g. 'Intro_to_Python_1.1', 'Untitled' etc.) at the top of the page and type the name you'd like. This will be used to save the notebook, as the chosen name + '.ipynb' (ipython notebook, the file type).\n",
