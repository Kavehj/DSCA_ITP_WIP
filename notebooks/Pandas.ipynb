    "# The Pandas Library - Objects for Data Science\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.1 General Purpose Objects\n",
    "\n",
    "The data structures - lists, tuples, and dictionaries, are the core, in-built data structures available in python. They are always available for use and easily created and destroyed. They are general purpose which means they are useful in many situations, however, they may not allow us to complete specific tasks as easily as we would like.\n",
    "\n",
    "Nonetheless, it is really important to know a bit about lists, tuples and dictionaries because they are used throughout python, and you will be very likely to encounter them in some form. Perhaps as an output from a function or method; as a way of providing input to a procedure; or, as the way that the library you are using stores properties.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many advanced python libraries that have been built for specific purposes, like data science, take advantage of the fact that objects are extensible. Programmers can create new classes based on existing objects and add in specific properties or methods that do specific things. This means that general purpose objects can be customised for particular tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "In data science applications, the Pandas library provides specialised objects that make working with data tables a lot easier than if we had to rely on python's general purpose objects. However, because pandas objects are specialised, they are also more complicated than general purpose objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pandas adds two important data structures that we need to know about. The 1 dimensional `Series` and the 2 dimensional `DataFrame`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.2 Series Objects\n",
    "\n",
    "* A Series is like a one-dimensional array (effectively a list) with a label for each observation.\n",
    "\n",
    "* You can think of a Series as being similar to a single column in a spreadsheet: a list of values.\n",
    "\n",
    "* However, the items in a Series must all be of the same data type, unlike a list.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The Series index provides a label for each observation, the default is for consecutive integer labels starting at 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "* However, a Series index does not have to be consecutive numbers, they can be non-unique numbers, non-consecutive numbers, as well as string objects or tuples.\n",
    "\n",
    "* As such, the Series itself is a bit like a list, whereas the Series index is a bit like a dictionary, and is able to return a value in the Series based on the index, like a key-value pair.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The Series object implements a large number of special behaviours (methods, procedures) that can be called on the data held in a Series to get useful outputs. This includes mathematical functions, like taking the average of all values in a numerical Series.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.3 DataFrame Objects\n",
    "\n",
    "* A DataFrame is a two-dimensional version of a Series object.\n",
    "\n",
    "* In effect, a DataFrame is a collection of Series objects - one Series for each column in the DataFrame.\n",
    "\n",
    "* A DataFrame is thus similar to a whole spreadsheet, like an Excel file, a STATA .dta file, a SAS file, an SPSS .sav file etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "* A DataFrame can hold columns with different data types, but as per Series above, any single column must contain values of the same data type.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The dimensions are labeled in a similar way to the Series object:\n",
    "\n",
    "    * **index** - refers to the row labels\n",
    "    * **columns** - refers to the column labels\n",
    "    \n",
    " * Having indexed data allows fast look up and powerful relational operations \n",
    " \n",
    " * Each row has a label and each column has a label\n",
    "\n",
    "Most the the time you'll be working with DataFrame objects in Pandas, however, as DataFrames are composed of Series, it is very likely that through indexing, selection, creation of new columns, and analysis you'll encounter Series objects too. Luckily, DataFrame and Series objects are similar, DataFrames effectively extend the Series into two-dimensions and as such implement some additional properties and methods that may not be relevant to Series on their own."
